# GRIP-Iris-Decision-Tree-Prediction

This repository is dedicated to creating a Decision Tree classifier for the Iris dataset. It provides comprehensive resources for data analysis, model training, and visualization.

This is a sample code written by me for training the "iris data", which is widely available. The implementation takes place within the Google Colab environment.

Key functionalities of this codebase include:

1. Generates a summary of the Iris dataset and provides an overview in the Google Colab.
2. Creates a Decision Tree classifier to predict class labels for the Iris dataset.
3. Displays a pair plot of the Iris data, showcasing the relationships between different features.
4. Visualize the Decision Tree classifier to gain insights into its structure and decision-making process.
5. Evaluates the performance of the Decision Tree classifier using appropriate metrics.

Feel free to explore this repository for a comprehensive example of creating and visualizing Decision Trees for the Iris dataset.
